<h3>Obtaining Predictions in Context Precipitation Information for a Selected Point</h3>

<p>To obtain bar graphs of monthly precipitation anomaly and percentile for the past 12 months, plots of climatological monthly and seasonal precipitation and tercile boundaries, and a histogram of the tercile probabilities for forecast precipitation for the next 3-month season,
 move your cursor over any land area location on the world
map and click.</p>

<p>You may <b>ZOOM</b> in on a desired region of the world <b> by
changing the latitude and longitude settings</b> of the display.
LATITUDE settings are located to the left of the world map, LONGITUDE
settings are located below the map. To specify a new latitude range,
edit the values in the boxes to the left of the map. Use "N" to 
indicate degrees north, "S" to indicate degrees south. Similary, to
specify new longitude settings, edit the values in the boxes below the
plot. Use "W" to indicate degrees west and "E" to indicate degees 
east.</p> 

<h3>Predictions in Context (PiC) Maps</h3>
<p>
We provide a climate perspective for regions of the world by displaying
a combination of observed and predicted precipitation. Shaded areas on
these maps are regions where the observed seasonal precipitation was in
the below-normal or above-normal range and forecasts indicate an enhanced
likelihood for the next season's precipitation to be below normal or
above-normal based on the <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.IRI/.FD/.Seasonal_Forecast/.Precipitation/">IRI mu
lti-model ensembles</a>.
</p>

<p>
Two sets of maps are presented. One set shows areas where the forecasts
indicate an enhanced likelihood for observed conditions to continue
(labeled "Same") and another set of maps to indicate an enhanced likelihood
that conditions will change (labeled "Reversed").  The forecasts are always
for the next 3-month period (season).  The observations are for either the
past 3 month or past 12-month period to provide a shorter-term and longer-term
context for the forecasts.  These maps are updated every month.
</p>

<h3>How the maps of precipitation persistence are generated</h3>

<p>These maps are generated each month based on the past few months' observed precipitation and the IRI
forecast for the next season.  Shaded areas are regions where rainfall observations fall into
below- or above-normal terciles and also have an enhanced porbability for below- or above-normal
precipitation forecast.
</p>

<p>NCEP gridded monthly precipitation data for 30 years (1969 to 1998) are used as the <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.ed
u/SOURCES/.IRI/.FD/.Seasonal_Forecast/.Climatologies/.c6998/.monthly/.prcp/">observational data reference</a>.
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP/.CPC/.CAMS_OPI/.v0208/.mean/.prcp/">CAMS-OPI monthly gridded prec
ipitation</a> is used for the observations for the past 3 and 12 months.
First, the rainfall observation for a chosen time period (most recent 3 months and 12 months in our case)
at any gridpoint is ranked into a 0 - 1 scale, with the 0 as the driest event in 30 years
for the same 3- or 12-month period, and 1.0 the wettest event.  A value of 0.333 and
less is considered dry (below-normal), and a  value of 0.667 and greater is considered wet (above-normal).
Secondly, the forecast for the next season for the same location is examined.  A forecast with a 40% or
greater probability for the below-normal category is considered an enhanced likelihood of dry forecast, and a forecast of
40% or greater for the above-normal category is considered an enhanced likelihood of wet forecast.
</p>

<p>
Based on the observation and forecast, two sets of maps are plotted.
One represents areas with enhanced likelihood of continued wetter or drier than average.
The maps' relative likelihoods of persistence are indicated for either wet or dry, depending on
whether the forecast probaility is 40-50% (lower intensity; labled "Enhanced"),
or 55% and higher (high intensity; labled "Greatly enhanced").
</p>

<p>
The second set of maps represents areas with enhanced likelihood of reversed tendency
regarding the most recent precipitation observation.  Such regions have either a below-normal
observed rainfall and an above-normal forecast for next season, or vice versa.
</p>

<p>It is anticipated that each rectangular region identified will have 
distinct interior climate variability, especially in area having terrain
features or near large bodies of water. The forecast should be interpreted
as a mean condition over the entire region.</p>
