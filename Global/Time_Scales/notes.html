<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the
decomposition of a signal into trend, low- and high-frequency
components may seem straightforward, the analysis presented by the
maproom involves a number of subtleties. This document provides a
more detailed look at the analytical procedures utilized than does
the overview presented in Greene et al. (2011), and offers as well a
number of caveats regarding interpretation of maproom displays.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Method</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The maproom decomposition is accomplished in
several steps, which are discussed here in turn.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Screening</B></P>
<P CLASS="western">The underlying datasets employed are <I>complete,
</I>i.e., they do not contain missing values. This does not mean,
however, that actual measurements were available for every month and
at every geographic location covered by the data. The requirement of
completeness was imposed so that the data could be utilized in
certain kinds of modeling experiments, and was met by “filling”
of missing values. The exact manner in which this filling was
performed varies by dataset; links to the appropriate documentation
are provided on the dataset pages.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the screening procedure employed here, the
number of actual station measurements contributing to each gridpoint
value is considered. If it is determined that the datum value is
essentially “synthetic,” i.e., has been filled, that point is
considered to be missing, and does not contribute to the minimum data
requirement required in order that the gridpoint be used in the
analysis. For precipitation no more than 50% of the values at any
gridpoint can be filled; for temperature none of the values can be
missing. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In addition there is the requirement that, for
precipitation, climatological seasonal rainfall must exceed 30 mm.
This would represent a very dry season or region, rendering the
utility of the time scales decomposition questionable. In addition,
even small fluctuations in precipitation would look “large”
compared with such a dry climatology, increasing the variance of
estimated precipitation variations. The minimum screening requirement
avoids these situations.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Gridpoints not meeting these requirements are
shown as blank on the maps presented; clicking on such points returns
a “no data” message. When the user selects “area average” for
a region, only those points meeting the minimum data requirements are
utilized in computing the area-averaged data.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>The trend component</B></P>
<P CLASS="western">Trends are often computed in the time domain, in
which case they might be expressed, for example, as a change of so
many millimeters per month occurring per ten-year period. The common
procedure of fitting a linear trend assumes that such a rate of
change is constant with time. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The map room takes a different approach, based on
a simple conceptual model: Rather than expressing local or regional
trends as functions of <I>time,</I> we relate them instead to global
<I>temperature</I> change. The assumption is not that precipitation
(or temperature) changes simply as a result of the passing of time,
but instead because of the warming of the planet. In some sense,
then, the trend component as computed in the maproom can be
identified with “climate change.” It thus has a functional,
rather than simply a numerical significance.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Computation of the global temperature record to be
used as a regression is less simple than it sounds. Fluctuations in
the Earth’s climate have many sources, including “natural”
variability — intrinsic variations that are not associated with
anthropogenically-induced climate change. Such variations, if large
enough in scale, can significantly influence, or “project” onto
the global mean temperature. If we take the latter to represent in
some sense the signature of climate change, there is a risk that we
will unintentionally include some component of natural variability,
which will then mistakenly be identified with this signature.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To circumvent this problem the global temperature
signal is computed using an ensemble of general circulation models
(GCMs). These models, which constitute a comprehensive representation
of our understanding of  the mechanisms of climate variability and
change, underlie much of the Fourth Assessment Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007). The
“Twentieth Century Climate in Coupled Models” (20C3M) simulations
are used. As with the real Earth, climate in each of these
simulations includes both a “forced” response (what we think of a
climate change) and natural, “unforced” variations. However, the
unforced variability is <I>incoherent</I> from model to model –
there is no synchronization or phase relationship among the models,
and indeed, the character of each model’s unforced variability
differs to some degree from that of the others. To obtain an estimate
of the forced response, we average together the 20<SUP>th</SUP>-century
global mean temperature records from the members of this ensemble,
which here includes 23 (nearly all) of the IPCC GCMs. Averaging has
the effect of attenuating the incoherent (i.e., uncorrelated)
unforced variability while enhancing that part of the response that
the models have in common – the climate change signal. The
multimodel averaging can thus be said to increase the signal-to-noise
ratio, where “signal” refers to the common climate change
response and “noise” the unforced natural variability. This ratio
is increased in the multimodel mean relative to that of the
individual simulations. Most of the models provide multiple 20C3M
simulations; to put the models on an even footing, a single
simulation from each model is used to create the multimodel average.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Since we expect that the signature of climate
change will be <I>smooth</I> (because changes in atmospheric
greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols and most other forcing factors
are, on the global scale, temporally smooth), the multimodel mean
signal is further processed, using a lowpass filter. This filtering,
which is performed in the time domain, has the effect of removing
most of the residual year-to-year variability that has not been
averaged away in the formation of the multimodel mean. The resulting
smoothed global temperature signal, which serves as the signature of
the forced climate change response, is shown in Fig. 1. Downward
“bumps” in this signal in the 1900s, 1960s and early 1990s can
probably be attributed, at least in part, to major volcanic
eruptions, which have a short-term cooling effect; to the extent that
these variations are expressed in regional signals they will be
recognized as part of the forced response. Although the forcing is
not anthropogenic in this case, it is nevertheless considered
“external” as far as the maproom is concerned: Volcanic eruptions
are not believed to be associated, at least in any easily
demonstrable way, with natural climate variability, so it would be
incorrect to treat them as such.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER>Figure 1: The global mean “climate
change” temperature record used for detrending.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The trend component of a local temperature or
precipitation signal is extracted by regressing the local series on
the global temperature signal of Fig 1. Fitted values from the
regression represent, by construction, that part of the regional
signal which is linearly dependent on global mean temperature. It is
in this sense that the trend, as here computed, may be thought of as
the climate change component of the regional signal.</P>
<P CLASS="western">It is worth noting that for a local or regional
signal that is being analyzed in the maproom, the entanglement of
forced and natural components is still possible. This is because,
while the signal of Fig. 1 has been effectively stripped of natural
internal variability, a real-world signal may still contain natural
components that are “masquerading” as trend. This might happen,
for example, if some natural mode of variability were to be
increasing over a relatively long time period, say the last 30 years
of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century. In such a case this mode might
motivate a similar increase in values of the regional series being
analyzed, which then “maps” onto the global mean temperature
increase shown in Fig. 1. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO,
see, e.g., Enfield, 2001) exhibits a signal something like this; to
the extent that the AMO influences local climate, there may be some
possibility for this sort of misidentification to occur. In general,
and for the more approximative type of assessment for which the
maproom is designed, we do not believe that such entanglement will
pose a major problem with interpretation.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Figure 2a illustrates the detrending step, as
applied to a typical precipitation record obtained from the maproom.
Note that the inferred trend is negative, and appears as a shifted,
scaled inversion of the signal shown in Fig. 1. The inverse
characteristic results from the fitting of a downward-trending
regional signal; the fact that the inferred trend is a scaled,
shifted version of the signal of Fig. 1 is a characteristic of the
linear regression. Recall, finally, that the inferred trend
represents a regression on global mean <I>temperature;</I> this
explains its nonlinearity in the time domain.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Figure 2: Stages of the
maproom decomposition process. (a) Trend component, represented by
the fitted values in a regression of the local signal onto the
multimodel mean temperature record of Fig. 1; (b) Residual signal
from this regression and its lowpass-filtered counterpart, the latter
identified with the decadal component of variability; (c) Interannual
component, which is the residual signal if (b), from which the
decadal component has been subtracted.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Decadal and Interannual components</B></P>
<P CLASS="western">If the fitted values from the regression onto the
global multimodel mean temperature record of Fig. 1 are taken as the
“climate change” trend, the residuals from this regression then
represent the natural, unforced component of variability. The next
step in the analysis aims to decompose this residual signal into
“decadal” and “interannual” components, representing
respectively the low- and high-frequency components of natural
variability.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To do this, the residuals are lowpassed by
filtering, using an order-five Butterworth filter with half-power at
a period of 10 year. Although the Butterworth design has some
desirable properties that make it well-suited to this task, any
number of alternate filtering procedures could also have been used.
Assuming that the filter is optimized to a minimal degree,  testing
indicates that results are not sensitive to the filter details.
Filter parameters were chosen (a) so as to effect a clean separation
between low- and high-frequency components without introducing
instability in the filter response (this refers to the filter order)
and (b) to effectively classify variability due to El Niño-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) as “interannual.” With the order-five filter,
covariation between the two components generally amounts to no more
than a few percent of the variance of the initial “raw” series.
(In the real world a “perfect” separation of time scales is not
achievable; all practical filter designs represent compromises in
this regard.)</P>
<P CLASS="western">ENSO exhibits a broad spectral peak in the 2-8
year band. Phenomena responsible for variability on longer time
scales belong to class of processes that are less well-understood,
and whose predictability is currently the subject of active research
(see, e.g., Meehl et al. 2009). This “low-frequency” class
includes large-scale modes such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
(PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), as well as
low-frequency stochastic variations. Thus the filtering effectively
partitions variability by process class, not simply by nominal time
scale.</P>
<P CLASS="western">This second stage in the decomposition in
illustrated in Fig. 2b, which shows in black the “natural”
residual from the detrending operation of Fig. 2a (i.e., the raw
signal minus the trend component). Superimposed on this is the green
“decadal” signal, which represents the output of the lowpass
filter, applied to the residual signal.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Finally, the interannual signal is computed as the
difference between black and green traces in Fig. 2b, i.e., the
residual from the detrending step minus its lowpassed incarnation.
Shown in Fig. 2c, this signal represents that part of natural
variability having its expression at periods shorter than ten years.
The trend (red), decadal (green) and interannual (blue) signals are
what is shown in the maproom when the user either clicks at a point
or chooses “area average,” the latter in order to display the
time scale decomposition as applied to an area-averaged signal.</P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As noted above, detrending via
	regression on the multimodel temperature record represents only an
	approximate separation of forced and natural variability; rigorously
	performed, such separation is not a simple exercise. Depending on
	timing and period, natural fluctuations in the data could project
	onto the multimodel mean temperature signal and be incorrectly
	identified with the forced response. The potential for such
	entanglement becomes lower as length-of-record increases, and vice
	versa.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We recommend the analysis of
	area-averaged data if possible, for a number of reasons. First, data
	at an individual gridpoint is likely to be <I>noisy. </I>For
	example, a couple of wet years near one terminus of the series could
	create the impression of a trend, even though there is no overall
	trend in the series. Even if the gridpoint passes the screening
	criteria described, a number of values may have been filled, with
	potentially misleading effects. These problems will generally be
	ameliorated to some degree by area-averaging, for the same reason
	that multimodel averaging increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the
	resultant series.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The maproom shows the percent of
	variance in the raw data that is explained by each of the three
	components. The alert user will notice that these percentages
	usually sum to less than one hundred percent. This is because the
	filtering procedure is necessarily imperfect, and does not
	completely separate the decadal and interannual components of the
	detrended series, leading to a degree of covariance between them.
	(This is the filtering problem known as “leakage.”) The value
	for this covariance value is also provided. Twice the covariance
	value, added to the trend, decadal and interannual variance
	percentages, should add to one hundred percent, give or take a
	percent for rounding error.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Regarding the decadal, or
	low-frequency component, it should be noted that about 20% of the
	variance of annually-resolved white noise would be expected to
	accrue to the decadal component, as here defined. White noise is a
	random process having no “memory,” in the sense that its value
	at a particular time does not depend on its values at any other
	previous time. This differs from processes having memory, in which
	the process level is dependent on previous values (such processes
	tend to vary more slowly than white noise). Thus, a decadal variance
	fraction of as much as 20% should not be mistaken for the signature
	of a mechanistic decadal “oscillation” that differs from white
	noise.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although the variance
	decomposition, or other aspects of the maproom plots may provide
	some sense of future expectations (in the statistical sense), the
	maproom is primarily a means of deconstructing past variations, not
	a predictive tool. In particular, it cannot tell us how the
	character of variability may change in response to global warming
	and thus, how the decomposition of variance might evolve with the
	passage of time.</P>
