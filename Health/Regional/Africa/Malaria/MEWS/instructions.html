<p><a name="map"><u><b>Interacting with the map</b></u>
<br>The map first displays the most recent dekadal precipitation estimates for 
Africa, but it is also meant to be a dynamic tool. Users may use the map viewer to:
<ul><li>Display precipitation estimates from any dekad from 6 Dec 1999 to the present</li>
<li>Animate precipitation estimates for any number of dekads</li>
<li>Overlay any combination of the following levels of administrative boundaries: coast, 
country, state/province, and district</li>
<li>Overlay a map of epidemic malaria risk zones</li>
<li>Zoom in to a more specific region of interest</li>
</ul>
<u><i>Display data from a different dekad</i></u>
<br>The date for which the displayed precipitation data is valid is shown to the lower left 
of the map.  To display data from a different time period:
<ol><li>Change the date in the text box above the map using the same format as the date
already shown.</li>
<li>Click the Redraw button to the left of the map (top of the three buttons).</li>
</ol>
Note that the buttons to the right of the date text box allow you to go directly to the dekads
immediately before and after the one currently displayed.
<p>
<u><i>Animate data from multiple dekads</i></u>
<br>Any number of time steps may be animated, but the time necessary to load the animation will 
increase with the number of time steps included in the selection.
<br><ol><li>In the date text box above the map, enter the start and end dates of the time period 
over which you would like to animate the data, separated by "to" (e.g., "21-30 Nov 2004 to 21-31 Dec 
2004").</li>
<li>Click the Redraw button to the left of the map (top of the three buttons).</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u><i>Overlay adminstrative boundaries and epidemiological mask</i></u>
<br>Any combination of the available overlay maps may be displayed.
<ol><li>Using the "Optional Overlay Maps" table located to the far left of the map, select the 
maps that you would like to display.</li> 
<li>Click the Redraw button to the left of the map (top of the three buttons).</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u><i>Zoom map in/out</i></u>
<br>There are two ways to zoom the map to different regions; a click-and-drag zoom window and the latitude/longitude text boxes. Note that the map can not display areas outside of the region first shown on the interface 
(i.e., 40S-40N, 20W-50E).
<br><ul><li><i>Click-and-drag zoom window</i>
<br><ol><li>Click and drag a window on the map over the region of interest.  The map will automatically zoom to that region when the mouse button is released.
<li>You can return to the full domain of the map at any time by clicking the Zoom Out button to the left of the map (middle of the three buttons).
</ol></li>
<li><i>Specific lat/lon selection</i>
<br>There are four lat/lon text boxes underneath and to the left of the map.
<br><ol><li>Change the values in the lat/lon text boxes to the limits of the region you would 
like to display using the text format already shown.</li>
<li>Click the Redraw button to the left of the map (top of the three buttons).</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<a name="timeseries"><u><b>Creating time series analyses</b></u>
<br>Users may generate time series analyses of precipitation at any location in Africa.
<p><u><i>Generate time series analysis</i></u>
<ol><li>Using the "Time Series Region" table to the right of the map, select the size of 
the region over which you want the precipitation to be spatially averaged.
<p>The CPC/FEWS RFE2.0 dataset has a very fine resolution (i.e., 0.1&deg;x0.1&deg;). It is 
therefore prudent to base this type of analysis on an average of multiple grid points.</li>
<li>Click on the map at the point you wish to be analyzed.  If you
chose a box region in Step 1, then the analysis will be based on the average of the data within 
that sized box <i>centered</i> on your selected point.<p>
Note that when selecting a district, it may be useful to zoom in to the region of interest and 
overlay district boundaries before generating the time series analysis.</li>
</ol>
<u><i>Custom modifications to time series graphs</i></u>
<br>After the time series analyses have been generated, the user has a few additional options 
to modify the presented plots.
<ul><li><i>Select specific lat/lon coordinate to analyze</i>
<br><ol><li>Select the size of the region to be included in the analysis from the pull-down 
menu.</li>
<li>Enter the latitude and longitude of the point of interest, or any point within 
the district of interest.</li>
<li>Click the "Generate new time series" button.</li>
</ol><p></li>
<li><i>Modify graphs</i>
<br><ol><li>Click on any of the graphs to bring up an interactive viewer that will allow you to
modify the aesthetics of the selected graph.</li>
<li>Change the values in the text boxes to modify the temporal range of the graph and/or the 
limits of the vertical axis.</li>
<li>Click the Redraw button to the left of the graph.</li>
</ol><p></li>
<li><i>Download graphs in a variety of formats</i>
<br><ol><li>Click on the graph of interest to bring up the interactive viewer, if you have not already 
done so (see <i>Modify graphs</i> above).</li>
<li>Select the desired download format (e.g., PostScript, JPEG, GIF, PNG) from the options 
available in the "Just the Figure Formats"  line of the table. Static URLs for the selected 
image are also available in the Page Fomats line of the table and more information about these 
page formats can be found by clicking the "Help" button.</li>
