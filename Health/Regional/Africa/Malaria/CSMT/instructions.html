<a name="timeseries"><u><b>Viewing climatological suitability for each month at a specific location</b></u>
<br>Users may view monthly climatological suitability for malaria transmission at any location 
on the map by simply clicking on it.
<p><a name="map"><u><b>Visual features of the map</b></u>
<br>The map first displays the number of months during the year in which climatological 
conditions are suitable for malaria transmission. 
Users may also use the map viewer to:
<ul><li>Overlay any combination of the following levels of administrative boundaries: coast, 
country, state/province, and district</li>
<li>Overlay a map of epidemic malaria risk zones</li>
<li>Zoom in to a more specific region of interest</li>
</ul>
<u><i>Overlay adminstrative boundaries and epidemiological mask</i></u>
<br>Any combination of the available overlay maps may be displayed.
<ol><li>Using the "Optional Overlay Maps" table located to the far left of the map, select the 
maps that you would like to display.</li> 
<li>Click the "Redraw" button (top blue button to left of map).</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u><i>Zoom map in/out</i></u>
<br>There are two ways to zoom the map to different regions; the click-and-drag option and the latitude/longitude 
text boxes. Note that the map can not display areas outside of the region first shown on the interface 
(i.e., 40S-40N, 20W-55E).
<br><ul><li><i>Click-and-drag</i>
</li>
<br><ol><li>Click the left mouse button at the upper-left corner of the region to which you would like 
to zoom.</li>
<li>While holding down the button, drag the mouse to the lower-right corner of the region to which you 
would like to zoom.</li>
<li>Release the left mouse button. The map will redraw automatically.<p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Specific lat/lon selection</i>
<br>There are four lat/lon text boxes underneath and to the left of the map.
<br><ol><li>Change the values in the lat/lon text boxes to the limits of the region you would 
like to display using the text format already shown.</li>
<li>Click the "Redraw" button.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
