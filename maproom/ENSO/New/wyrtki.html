 <h1 align="center"  property="term:title" >Wyrtki: Linking ocean currents with El Nino</h1>
<p align="left" property="term:description">
Klaus Wyrtki is credited with deriving the theory that El Nino is driven by changes in sea level heights from the development of a countercurrent
</p>

 <p>
Bjerknes had pointed out that during El Niño the ocean had to be responding dynamically rather than to changes in the surface heat flux. This concept was first developed into a specific theory by Klaus Wyrtki, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii. Wyrtki discovered the changes in the Pacific Equatorial Countercurrent and its relationship to ENSO in the 1970's.
</p>
<p>
Wyrtki had a network of tide gauges in the tropical Pacific which gave records of sea level. In the tropics, monthly average sea level is an excellent substitute for the monthly average depth of the thermocline -- that is, for the thickness of the upper ocean warm layer. Wyrtki showed that an El Niño event is associated (preceded in fact) by a transfer of warm water from west to east. The figure below shows a sequence of sea level (thermocline depth) maps for 1975-6 (an ENSO year). Initially sea level is low in the east and high in the west, but by April 1976 sea level in the east is already high. This precedes the warmest SST anomalies there. It is this transfer of warm water to the east that triggers the warm phase of ENSO. 
</p>
<p>
It is the transfer of warm water to the east that triggers a warm event But what triggers the movement of waters to the east? Think of the tropical Pacific as a huge tub, with the waters sloshing back and forth. In the cold phase the warm waters are low in the east, so they must be high somewhere else. This is because water is conserved and because warm water is very nearly conserved: there is some heat exchange with the atmosphere, but from the ocean's point of view it doesn't amount to much. (From the atmosphere's point of view its quite a lot -- it is just this rearrangement of the atmospheric heating that sets off the worldwide climate anomalies associated with El Niño.) The "somewhere else" that the water level is high is primarily the western tropical Pacific. Eventually this water will return to the east and set off the next warm event. Most immediately, it pushes down the thermocline and raises the temperature of the upwelled waters. The Bjerkness positive feedback takes over: the winds weaken and still more water flows east and SSTs warm. The main center of atmospheric convection shifts eastward, disrupting the world's "normal" weather patterns. The eastward sloshing overshoots any equilibrium. Since there is now more warm water in the east, there is less in the west. Eventually this message (the raised thermocline signal ) is transmitted back to the east and the warm event starts to weaken, to be replaced in turn by a normal to cold phase. And so on, forever (or at least thousands of years, judging from the observational record). There is one more wrinkle in the story to point out: part of what makes the oscillation possible is an asymmetry between eastward and westward motions in the ocean. Along the equator there is a relatively fast eastward (and only eastward) motion called an equatorial Kelvin wave. Peaking somewhat off the equator are westward motions called Rossby waves. These carry the message of the high (say) thermocline in the west westward to the boundary of the ocean (Philippines, New Guinea, Australia) where they are reflected eastward in the equatorial Kelvin wave. This delay is needed for the oscillation -- without it one would have the amplification in place that Bjerkness contemplated.
