During El Nino conditions, the usually present westward winds weaken and an anomalous eastward flow develops. This condition is responsible for bringing warm equatorial waters from the western Pacific towards the eastern Pacific and northern South America. 
</p>
<p>
Impacts of El Nino in the eastern equatorial Pacific include an increase in sea level heights, a decrease in cool water upwelling and an increase in sea surface temperature. An increase in sea surface temperature leads to an increase in convection and an increase in the risk for heavy precipitation in northwestern South America. 
</p>

<h4>During El Nino, the following conditions are likely</h4>

<p>
<ul>

   				<p>
                  <li>
                  <b>Surface Water Circulation</b> Towards the East- Under El Nino conditions, the sea surface waters are cooler than average in the western Pacific and warmer than average in the eastern Pacific. This creates a eastward thermal current near the surface (dense (cold) trying to go to less dense (warm)).  
                  </li>
                  </p>
                  
                <p>
                  <li>
                  <b>Lower Atmospheric Circulation</b> Towards the East- The current of water that is near the sea surface creates a direct thermal circulation in the lower atmosphere towards the East. Essentially, the waters just below and at the surface are moving East and the winds right above the surface are moving East in El Nino conditions. 
                  </li>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <li><b>Upper Atmospheric Circulation</b> Towards the West- The lower level circulation towards the East creates a situation where there is colder than average water and air being brought into a region of warmer than average water and air. When the relatively colder air and water hits the relatively warmer air and water it evaporates and forms into clouds and eventually precipitation. Once the clouds form, the air parcel rises and leads to a reverse circulation in the upper atmosphere towards the West. 
                  </li>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <li><b>Thermocline</b> Decrease in slope down from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific. The thermocline marks the furthest extent of upward movement of deep, cold water under the ocean. Even though the thermocline doesn't reach the surface, it comes closer in some areas (like the eastern Pacific) than in others (western Pacific), leading to the eastern Pacific usually experiencing colder water temperatures near the surface than the western Pacific. During El Nino, the slope of the thermocline decrease, allowing for warmer surface water to penetrate eastern areas of the equatorial Pacific. 
                  </li>
                </p>
               </ul>

</p>



<h4>Onset</h4>
In the fall preceeding El Ni&ntilde;o, the warm anomaly in the South Pacific develops a northward
extension across the equator in the vicinity of the date line.  This is associated with a northeast
shift of the South Pacific Convergence Zone, which brings it closer to the equator than normal.  The
easterlies west of the dateline have started to diminish, and the sea-level slope along the equator has
begun to relax.  There are positive precipitation anomalies west of the date line, but no discernable
pattern to the convergence anomalies.

<h4>Event</h4><p>
The anomalies warming off the coast of South America begins in January or February and increases until
June.  For the first several months it is difficult to distinguish it from the normal warming that
occurs every winter.  At the same time, the sea level rises in a narrow region along the South American
coast and the thermocline in the Eastern Pacific deepens.  There is a strong southward flow at the
coast, as well as evidence for a sea-level rise north of the equator.  The SST anomaly at the equator
in the vicinity of the date line persists and can potentially expand throughout this period.  At this
time, there are westerly wind anomalies along the equator, with maximum shear near the date line.  The
Intertropical Convergence Zone has shifted equatorward in the east, so there is enhanced convergence
and precipitation all along the equator, including many sections of Peru.</p>

<p>During the next half year, the warm anomaly spreads northwestward and then westward along the
equator at a speed of about 1 m/s.  By late fall the eastern anomaly has merged with the one in the
central Pacific: Warm water now girdles a quarter of the Earth.  At this time, SST at the coast is only
slightly anomalous, although the thermocline is still substantially deeper than normal there.</p>
