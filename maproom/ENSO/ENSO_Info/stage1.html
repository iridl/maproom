<h1>The Southern Oscillation</h1>

<br><br>
Normally, the Indian Monsoon brings sufficient rainfall to the Indian subcontinent to provide enough moisture for crops to survive.

In 1877, the region experienced the worst famine in its history, due to the failure of the monsoon rains.
As a result, an observatory was founded to explore whether future famines could be prevented.  In 1904, Sir Gilbert Walker, a British mathematician entered British Colonial Service as director general
of the observatory, with the goal of predicting the Asian monsoon fluctuations. Walker sorted through world weather records dating from just before the turn of the<img src="mslp.gif" align=right> 20th century
which described the sea level pressure swing between South America and India-Australia.   He found that many global climate variations were correlated with the Southern
     Oscillation, a large scale see-sawing of mass between the eastern and western sides of the
     tropical Pacific <br><br><p>
    Normally, mean sea level pressure (SLP) is relatively high in the south central Pacific (e.g.
     Tahiti) and SLP is relatively low over the Indian Ocean and Northern Australia (e.g. Darwin), with
     a net transport of air at low latitude from east to west -- the easterly trade winds 
     Every few years the SLP difference between east and west weakens; consequently the trades
     relax and there is often drought in India and Australia. Monsoon precipitation correlations to the Southern
     Oscillation were
     established by Walker et al in the mid 1920s <br><br><br>
     A widely used index of the strength of the Southern Oscillation, the Southern Oscillation
     Index (SOI) is given by the normalized difference, SLP at Tahiti - SLP at Darwin.
     Barometric records at those stations go back to the 1880's. 
     There is a tight coupling between the Southern Oscillation and eastern equatorial sea surface temperatures
      -- that is, El Ni&ntilde;o. The figure below is a time series of SOI plotted against a widely used El Ni&ntilde;o index called NINO3. NINO3
     is the sea surface temperature anomaly (departure from normal) averaged over the equatorial eastern Pacific <br><br>

Walker, however, failed to make the connection between the Southern Oscillation and El Ni&ntilde;o. This link was made convincingly
     by the Norwegian America meteorologist, <a href="stage2.html">Jacob Bjerknes</a>.
