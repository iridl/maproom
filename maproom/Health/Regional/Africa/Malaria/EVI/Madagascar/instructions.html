<p><a name="map"><u><b>Interacting with the map</b></u>
<br>The map first displays the most recent 16-day Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) for 
Madagascar, but it is also meant to be a dynamic tool. The map viewer can:
<ul><li>Display EVI data for any 16-day period from February 2005 to the present</li>
<li>Animate EVI images</li>
<li>Overlay any combination of the following levels of administrative boundaries: coast, 
country, state/province, and district</li>
<li>Zoom in to a more specific region of interest</li>
</ul>
<u><i>Display data for a different time period</i></u>
<br>The date for which the displayed EVI data is valid is shown to the lower left 
of the map.  To display data from a different time period:
<ol><li>Change the date in the text box above the map using the same format as the date
already shown (e.g., 1-16 Jan 2006). If you enter a single date (e.g., 5 Jan 2006), then the interface 
will select the nearest 16-day period for which data is available.</li>
<li>Click the "Redraw" button.</li>
</ol>
Note that the buttons to the right of the date text box allow you to go directly to the 16-day periods
immediately before and after the one currently displayed.
<p>
<u><i>Animate data from multiple 16-day periods</i></u>
<br>Any number of time steps may be animated, but the time necessary to load the animation will 
increase with the number of time steps included in the selection.
<br><ol><li>In the date text box above the map, enter the start and end dates of the time period 
over which you would like to animate, separated by "to" (e.g., "1-16 Jan 2005 to 17 Jan 2006 - 1 Feb 2006" or 
"8 Jan 2006 to 25 Jan 2006").</li>
<li>Click the "Redraw" button.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u><i>Overlay adminstrative boundaries</i></u>
<br>Any combination of the available overlay maps may be displayed.
<ol><li>Using the "Optional Overlay Maps" table located to the far left of the map, select the 
overlays that you would like to display.</li> 
<li>Click the "Redraw" button.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u><i>Zoom map in/out</i></u>
<br>There are two ways to zoom the map to different regions; the click-and-drag option and the latitude/longitude 
text boxes. Note that the map can not display areas outside of the region first shown on the interface 
(i.e., 26&deg;S-10&deg;S, 41&deg;E-51&deg;E).
<br><ul><li><i>Click-and-drag</i>
</li>
<br><ol><li>Click the left mouse button at the upper-left corner of the region to which you would like 
to zoom.</li>
<li>While holding down the button, drag the mouse to the lower-right corner of the region to which you 
would like to zoom.</li>
<li>Release the left mouse button. The map will redraw automatically.<p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Specific lat/lon selection</i>
<br>There are four lat/lon text boxes underneath and to the left of the map.
<br><ol><li>Change the values in the lat/lon text boxes to the limits of the region you would 
like to display using the text format already shown.</li>
<li>Click the "Redraw" button.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<a name="timeseries"><u><b>Creating time series analyses</b></u>
<br>Users may generate time series analyses of EVI at any location on the map.
<p><u><i>Generate time series analysis</i></u>
<ol><li>Using the "Time Series Region" table to the right of the map, select the size of 
the region over which you want the data to be spatially averaged.
</li>
<li>Click on the map at the point you wish to be analyzed.  If you
chose a box region in Step 1, then the analysis will be based on the average of the data within 
the grid box nearest to this point.<p>
Note that when selecting a district, it may be useful to zoom in to the region of interest and 
overlay district boudaries before generating the time series analysis.</li>
</ol>
<br><u><i>Custom modifications to time series graphs</i></u>
<br>After the time series analyses have been generated, the user has a few additional options 
to modify the presented plots.
<ul><li><i>Select specific lat/lon coordinate to analyze</i>
<br><ol><li>Select the size of the region to be included in the analysis from the pull-down 
menu.</li>
<li>Enter the latitude and longitude of the point of interest, or any point within 
the district of interest.</li>
<li>Click the "Generate new time series" button.</li>
</ol><p></li>
<li><i>Modify graphs</i>
<br><ol><li>Click on any of the graphs to bring up an interactive viewer that will allow you to
modify the aesthetics of the selected graph.</li>
<li>Change the values in the text boxes to modify the temporal range of the graph and/or the 
limits of the vertical axis.</li>
<li>Click the "Redraw" button.</li>
</ol><p></li>
<li><i>Download graphs in a variety of formats</i>
<br><ol><li>Click on the graph of interest to bring up the interactive viewer, if you have not already 
done so (see <i>Modify graphs</i> above).</li>
<li>Select the desired download format (e.g., PostScript, JPEG, GIF, PNG) from the options 
available in the "Just the Figure Formats"  line of the table. Static URLs for the selected 
image are also available in the Page Fomats line of the table and more information about these 
page formats can be found by clicking the "Help" button.</li>
