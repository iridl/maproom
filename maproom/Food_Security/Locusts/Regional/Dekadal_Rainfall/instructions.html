<p><a name="map"><u><b>Visual features of the map</b></u>
<br>The map first displays the most recent dekadal rainfall estimates, but it is also meant to be a dynamic tool. Users may also use the map viewer to:
<ul>
<li>Display dekadal precipitation estimates from 11-20 Dec 2002 to the most recently available dekad</li>
<li>Animate precipitation estimates for any number of dekads</li>
<li>Overlay any combination of the following levels of administrative boundaries: coast, 
country, state/province, and district</li>
<li>Zoom in to a more specific region of interest</li>
</ul>
<p>
<u><i>Display data for a different dekad</i></u>
<br>The dekad for which the displayed precipitation data is valid is shown to the lower left
of the map.  To display data from a different time period:
<ol><li>Change the date in the text box above the map using the same format as the date already shown.</li>
<li>Click the "Redraw" button to the left of the map (the topmost of the three buttons).</li>
</ol>
Note that the buttons to the right of the date text box allow you to go directly to the dekads
immediately before and after the one currently displayed.
<p>
<u><i>Animate data from multiple dekads</i></u>
<br>Any number of time steps may be animated, but the time necessary to load the animation will increase
with the number of time steps included in the selection.
<br><ol><li>In the date text box above the map, enter the starting and ending dekads of the time period
over which you would like to animate the data, separated by "to" (e.g., "11-20 Dec 2002 to 21-31 Dec 2003").</li>
<li>Click the "Redraw" button to the left of the map (the topmost of the three buttons).</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u><i>Overlay adminstrative boundaries</i></u>
<br>Any combination of the available overlay maps may be displayed.
<ol><li>Using the "Optional Overlay Maps" table located to the far right of the map, select the 
maps that you would like to display.</li> 
<li>Click the "Redraw" button (top blue button to left of map).</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u><i>Zoom map in/out</i></u>
<br>There are two ways to zoom the map to different regions; the click-and-drag option and the latitude/longitude 
text boxes. Note that the map can not display areas outside of the region first shown on the interface 
(i.e., 4.25&deg;S-40.25&deg;N, 20.25&deg;W-95.25&deg;E).
<br><ul><li><i>Click-and-drag</i>
</li>
<br><ol><li>Click the left mouse button at the upper-left corner of the region to which you would like 
to zoom.</li>
<li>While holding down the button, drag the mouse to the lower-right corner of the region to which you 
would like to zoom.</li>
<li>Release the left mouse button. The map will redraw automatically.<p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Specific lat/lon selection</i>
<br>There are four lat/lon text boxes underneath and to the left of the map.
<br><ol><li>Change the values in the lat/lon text boxes to the limits of the region you would 
like to display using the text format already shown.</li>
<li>Click the "Redraw" button.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
