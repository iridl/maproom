<h2>Predictions in Context (PiC)</h2>

<p>
We provide a climate perspective for regions of the world by displaying
a combination of observed and predicted precipitation. Shaded areas on
these maps are regions where the observed seasonal precipitation was in
the below-normal or above-normal range and forecasts indicate an enhanced
likelihood for the next season's precipitation to be below normal or
above-normal based on the <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.IRI/.FD/.Seasonal_Forecast/.Precipitation/">IRI multi-model ensembles</a>.
</p>

<p>
Two sets of maps are presented. One set shows areas where the forecasts
indicate an enhanced likelihood for observed conditions to continue
(labeled "Same") and another set of maps to indicate an enhanced likelihood
that conditions will change (labeled "Reversed").  The forecasts are always
for the next 3-month period (season).  The observations are for either the
past 3 month or past 12-month period to provide a shorter-term and longer-term
context for the forecasts.  These maps are updated every month.
</p>

<h3>How the maps of precipitation persistence are generated</h3>

<p>These maps are generated each month based on the past few months' observed precipitation and the IRI
forecast for the next season.  Shaded areas are regions where rainfall observations fall into
below- or above-normal terciles and also have an enhanced porbability for below- or above-normal
precipitation forecast.
</p>

<p>NCEP gridded monthly precipitation data for 30 years (1969 to 1998) are used as the 
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.IRI/.FD/.Seasonal_Forecast/.Climatologies/.c6998/.monthly/.prcp/">observational data reference</a>.
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCEP/.CPC/.CAMS_OPI/.v0208/.mean/.prcp/">CAMS-OPI 
monthly gridded precipitation</a> is used for the observations for the past 3 and 12 months.
First, the rainfall observation for a chosen time period (most recent 3 months and 12 months in our case)
at any gridpoint is ranked into a 0 - 1 scale, with the 0 as the driest event in 30 years
for the same 3- or 12-month period, and 1.0 the wettest event.  A value of 0.333 and
less is considered dry (below-normal), and a  value of 0.667 and greater is considered wet (above-normal).

Secondly, the forecast for the next season for the same location is examined.  A forecast with a 40% or
greater probability for the below-normal category is considered an enhanced likelihood of dry forecast, 
and a forecast of
40% or greater for the above-normal category is considered an enhanced likelihood of wet forecast.
</p>

<p>
Based on the observation and forecast, two sets of maps are plotted.
The <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/.Global/.Forecasts/.PiC/.Same_3_Months/">Same 3 Months</a> and <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/.Global/.Forecasts/.PiC/.Same_12_Months/">Same 12 Months</a> maps represent areas with enhanced likelihood of continued wetter 
or drier than average conditions, based on observations from the past 3 months and past 12 months, respectively.
The maps' relative likelihoods of persistence are indicated for either wet or dry, depending on
whether the forecast probaility is 40-50% (lower intensity; labled "Enhanced"),
or 55% and higher (high intensity; labled "Greatly enhanced").
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/.Global/.Forecasts/.PiC/.Reversed_3_Months/">Reversed 3 Months</a> and <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/.Global/.Forecasts/.PiC/.Reversed_12_Months/index.html">Reversed 12 Months</a> maps represent areas with enhanced likelihood of reversed tendency
regarding the precipitation observations from the most recent 3-month and 12-month periods, respectively.  Such regions have either a below-normal
observed rainfall and an above-normal forecast for next season, or vice versa.
</p>

<p>
It is anticipated that each grid box identified will have distict interior climate variability, especially in areas having terrain features, or near large bodies of water.  The forecast should be interpreted as a mean condition over the entire region.
